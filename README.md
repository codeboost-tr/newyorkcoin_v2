## About NewYorkCoin Core v2.0

NewYorkCoin Core v2.0 is a **modernised full-node wallet** forked from
[Litecoin Core v0.21.4](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin), which is
itself a fork of [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin).

### Goals

#### Completed

1. **Restore a maintained full-node client** — the original NYC 1.x codebase is
   based on Bitcoin Core 0.10 (2015). v2.0 brings the codebase forward to a
   modern base (0.21.x) with active upstream security backports.

2. **Full NYC network compatibility** — correct network magic
   (`0xC0 0xC0 0xC0 0xC0`), protocol version 70012, and chain parameters
   matching the live NYC mainnet (genesis block, ports, address prefixes).

3. **Clean branding** — all Litecoin/Bitcoin strings replaced with
   NewYorkCoin/NYC throughout the Qt GUI, RPC responses, signed-message magic,
   URI handling, and user-facing text.

4. **Legacy address generation** — wallet defaults to `OutputType::LEGACY` so
   receive addresses begin with `R`, matching addresses used on exchanges and
   the original 1.x wallet.

5. **Merged mining (AuxPoW)** — NYC uses chain ID **1985** (0x07C1) and follows
   the Namecoin/Dogecoin AuxPoW protocol. Pools can merge-mine NYC alongside any
   other Scrypt coin. The `getauxblock` RPC provides the work interface.

6. **Android companion wallet** — the
   [nyc-openwallet-android](https://github.com/openwalletGH/openwallet-android)
   project provides a lightweight SPV wallet that can connect to this full node.

7. **ElectrumX server** — public ElectrumX endpoint at `electrum.paywith.nyc:50002`
   (SSL) for lightweight wallet connectivity without running a full node.

8. **Rosetta API** — the
   [Coinbase Rosetta](https://docs.cloud.coinbase.com/rosetta/docs/welcome)
   middleware service (`mesh-newyorkcoin`) is **deployed** on the public VPS
   at `http://74.208.146.8:8081`.  It runs in External RPC mode, connecting to
   the local `nycd` node via HTTP Basic Auth without managing its own daemon.
   Endpoints: `/network/list`, `/network/status`, `/block`, `/account/balance`,
   `/mempool`, and `/construction/*`.

#### In Progress

9. **MimbleWimble (MWEB)** — MimbleWimble extension blocks are **scheduled for
   activation** via BIP9 bit 4 miner signaling between blocks
   **15,000,000 – 17,000,000**.  The full Litecoin MWEB implementation
   (source files under `src/mweb/`) is present and compiled in; the MWEB
   bech32 HRP is `nycmweb`.  Miners must signal ≥ 2160 of any 2880-block
   period within that window to lock in.  The signaling window opens at block
   15,000,000 (estimated ~Dec 2026).

#### Planned

10. **Atomic Swaps** — cross-chain atomic swaps with Bitcoin, Litecoin, and other
   HTLC-compatible chains, enabling trustless peer-to-peer NYC exchanges without
   a centralised intermediary.

11. **NYC Ordinals** — an ordinals/inscription protocol for the NYC chain,
    analogous to Bitcoin Ordinals. NYC's 30-second blocks and low fees make it
    well-suited for high-throughput inscription use-cases.

12. **SegWit & Taproot addresses** — activate SegWit (P2WPKH/P2WSH, bech32
    `nyc1q...`) and Taproot (P2TR, bech32m `nyc1p...`) to reduce transaction fees,
    enable more complex scripts, and lay the groundwork for the Lightning Network.

13. **Custom OP_CODE scripting** — extend NYC's script interpreter with
    domain-specific opcodes useful for DeFi-style contracts, cross-chain
    commitments, and ordinals metadata — building on the Taproot script path
    infrastructure.

14. **DNS seed infrastructure, checkpoints, and security audit** — add reliable
    DNS seeds, embed mainnet checkpoints, and commission a third-party security
    audit before recommending production use.

## Soft-Fork Activation Schedule (v2.0)

All activations listed below are **soft forks** — they tighten validation
rules. Nodes running v1.14.x or v1.3.x remain on the same chain and are
unaffected until each height is reached.

| Soft Fork | BIPs | Activation Height | Approx. Date | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------------------|-------------|-------|
| P2SH | BIP16 | **0** (genesis) | March 2014 | Always active |
| CSV (relative lock-times) | BIP68, 112, 113 | **13,000,000** | ~Aug 2026 | ~138 days above current tip (~12.6M) |
| SegWit | BIP141, 143, 147 | **13,500,000** | ~Sep 2026 | Enables `nyc1q...` bech32 addresses; legacy wallets unaffected |
| Taproot | BIP340, 341, 342 | BIP9 bit 2, blocks 14,000,000–16,000,000 | ~Nov 2026+ | Requires SegWit; 75% of 2880-block window to lock in |
| MWEB (MimbleWimble) | — | BIP9 bit 4, blocks **15,000,000–17,000,000** | ~Dec 2026+ | Overlaps Taproot window; same 75% threshold; HRP `nycmweb` |
| BIP34 / BIP65 / BIP66 | — | `INT_MAX` (deferred) | TBD | Requires miners to change coinbase format; will be coordinated in a v2.1 release |

### Miner confirmation window

- `nMinerConfirmationWindow` = **2880 blocks** (~24 hours at 30 s/block)
- `nRuleChangeActivationThreshold` = **2160 blocks** (75 % of window)

So Taproot locks in when ≥ 2160 of any rolling 2880-block window within
blocks 14,000,000 – 16,000,000 signal BIP9 bit 2.

Similarly, MWEB locks in when ≥ 2160 of any rolling 2880-block window within
blocks 15,000,000 – 17,000,000 signal BIP9 bit 4.  Both windows can be
signaled simultaneously (different bits).

## Build Instructions

See the platform-specific docs in [`doc/`](doc/):

- [Linux](doc/build-unix.md)
- [macOS](doc/build-osx.md)
- [Windows (cross-compile)](doc/build-windows.md)

Quick start on Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config \
  bsdmainutils python3 libssl-dev libevent-dev libboost-all-dev \
  libminiupnpc-dev libzmq3-dev libqt5gui5 libqt5core5a libqt5dbus5 \
  qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libdb5.3++-dev

# Configure and build (daemon + GUI)
./autogen.sh
./configure --with-gui=qt5
make -j$(nproc)

# Binaries produced:
#   src/nycd           (daemon)
#   src/nyc-cli        (CLI)
#   src/qt/nyc-qt      (Qt GUI wallet)
#   src/nyc-tx         (transaction utility)
#   src/nyc-wallet     (wallet utility)
```

> **Note (Ubuntu 22.04+ / 24.04):** If `./autogen.sh` fails with
> `ltmain.sh: No such file or directory`, run these two commands instead:
> ```bash
> libtoolize --copy --force
> autoreconf -fiv
> ```
> Then proceed with `./configure` as normal.

**Daemon-only build** (no Qt, no wallet — suitable for headless VPS):

```bash
libtoolize --copy --force
autoreconf -fiv
./configure --without-gui --disable-wallet --disable-tests --disable-bench
make -j$(nproc)
# Installs to /usr/local/bin/nycd, nyc-cli, nyc-tx
sudo make install
# Copy to the legacy binary name used by service files:
sudo cp /usr/local/bin/nycd /usr/local/bin/newyorkcoind
sudo cp /usr/local/bin/nyc-cli /usr/local/bin/newyorkcoin-cli
```

### Connecting to the Network

Create `~/.newyorkcoin/newyorkcoin.conf` (or pass `-datadir=<path>`):

```ini
# Known active mainnet nodes (April 2026)
addnode=24.52.248.184
addnode=37.59.20.42
addnode=66.70.182.1
addnode=85.19.25.38
```

---

## Rosetta API (mesh-newyorkcoin)

The `mesh-newyorkcoin` service implements the
[Coinbase Rosetta](https://docs.cloud.coinbase.com/rosetta/docs/welcome) spec
as a Go middleware that proxies requests to the running `nycd` node over
JSON-RPC with HTTP Basic Auth.

### Public endpoint

```
http://74.208.146.8:8081
```

### Running in External RPC mode

The service accepts three additional environment variables when you already
have a `nycd` node running:

| Variable | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `EXTERNAL_RPC` | `true` | Skip launching the bundled node; connect to an existing one |
| `RPC_USER` | `<rpcuser>` | RPC username from `newyorkcoin.conf` |
| `RPC_PASSWORD` | `<rpcpassword>` | RPC password from `newyorkcoin.conf` |

Example systemd `Environment=` lines:

```ini
Environment=MODE=ONLINE
Environment=NETWORK=MAINNET
Environment=PORT=8081
Environment=EXTERNAL_RPC=true
Environment=RPC_USER=nycnode
Environment=RPC_PASSWORD=<your-rpc-password>
```

### Quick test

```bash
curl -s http://74.208.146.8:8081/network/list
# {"network_identifiers":[{"blockchain":"NewYorkCoin","network":"Mainnet"}]}

curl -s -X POST http://74.208.146.8:8081/network/status \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"network_identifier":{"blockchain":"NewYorkCoin","network":"Mainnet"}}'
```

## Merged Mining (AuxPoW)

NewYorkCoin Core v2.0 supports **merge mining** via the AuxPoW protocol
(the same system used by Namecoin, Dogecoin, and others).

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Chain ID | **1985** (0x07C1) |
| PoW algo | Scrypt (1024/1/1) |
| Block version flag | `0x100` (bit 8 of nVersion) |
| nVersion of AuxPoW block | `(1985 << 16) \| 0x100 \| base` = `0x07C10101` |

### How it works

A miner places the NYC block hash inside the coinbase scriptSig of a parent
chain block (e.g. a Litecoin or Dogecoin block) using the magic bytes
`0xfabe6d6d`.  When the parent block solves its own difficulty, the miner
submits the parent block header and coinbase merkle proof to NYC as an AuxPoW
solution.  As long as the parent block's Scrypt hash satisfies NYC's current
target, the NYC block is accepted.

### Pool integration — `getauxblock` RPC

```bash
# Create a new work item (returns block hash, target, height, etc.)
nyc-cli getauxblock

# Submit a solved AuxPoW
nyc-cli getauxblock <hash> <auxpow-hex>
```

The returned JSON contains:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `hash` | NYC block hash to embed in the parent coinbase |
| `chainid` | Always 1985 (0x07C1) |
| `previousblockhash` | Current chain tip |
| `coinbasevalue` | Total block reward available (satoshis) |
| `bits` | Compact difficulty target |
| `height` | Height of the next block |
| `target` | Full 256-bit PoW target (big-endian hex) |

### Coinbase commitment format

```
OP_RETURN  (or anywhere in scriptSig)
  0xfabe6d6d          -- 4-byte merged-mining magic
  <chainRoot>         -- 32 bytes: chain merkle tree root (= NYC block hash
                         when mining NYC alone, i.e. nSize=1)
  <nSize>             -- uint32 LE: 2^(chain branch height), 1 for solo NYC
  <nNonce>            -- uint32 LE: chainId % nSize, 0 for solo NYC (1985%1=0)
```
